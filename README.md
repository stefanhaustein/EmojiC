# EmojiC

A simple Android demo application utilizing [https://github.com/kobjects/emoji]

The application shows 5 emoji characters and a logical expression at the top of the screen. Swipe matching emoji to the right and mismatches to the left. An example expression may be "food and not green". The red apple emoji matches this and is supposed to be swiped to the right. A green apple or red heart do not match and are supposed to be swiped to the left.
The purpose of the app is to have some fun while learning simple logical formulas. There is a time limit, and expressions get more complex over time.

The app name is supposed to be a combination of the words "emoji" and "logic".

The source code for this app is available at https://github.com/stefanhaustein/EmojiC
